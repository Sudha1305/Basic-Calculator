# Basic-Calculator

**NAME: K.GNANASUDHAMA**

**COMPANY: Vault of codes**

This Python program is a basic calculator that allows the user to perform one operation (addition, subtraction, 

multiplication, division, or power) between two numbers.

It also includes error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero.

Function Definitions

add(a, b) → Returns the sum of a and b.

subtract(a, b) → Returns the difference of a and b.

multiply(a, b) → Returns the product of a and b.

divide(a, b) → Returns the quotient of a and b, or an error message if b is zero.

power(a, b) → Returns a raised to the power of b.

User Input with Error Handling

The program asks the user to enter two numbers.

If the user enters a non-numeric value, it prints an error message and exits using exit().

**Menu Display:**

A menu is shown with five operations:

Addition (+),Subtraction (-),Multiplication (*),Division (/),Power (^)

**Operation Selection:**

The user chooses an operation by entering a number (1–5).

Based on the choice, the corresponding function is called, and the result is printed.

If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays "Invalid choice."

**Program Termination:**

After performing the chosen operation and displaying the result, the program ends immediately.

**Error Handling:**

Catches invalid number inputs using try–except.

Prevents division by zero with a conditional check.

Simple Menu: Easy-to-read numbered list for selecting operations.

Single Execution: Runs once and exits after showing the result.

**OUTPUT:**
